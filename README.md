 # richard-pokee/crm-admin

 This repository contains test scripts for administering a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The scripts are written in Python and are intended to be used for automated testing of CRM functionalities.

 ## Purpose

 The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a set of automated tests that can be used to ensure the CRM system is functioning correctly. These tests can be run as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline or manually to verify specific functionalities.

 ## Files

 - README.md: This file, providing information about the repository.
 - test_one.py: A Python script containing one or more test cases for CRM administration. The specific functionalities tested are detailed within the script.
 - test_two.py: Another Python script containing one or more test cases for CRM administration. The specific functionalities tested are detailed within the script.

 ## How to Use

 1.  **Prerequisites:**
  - Python 3.6 or higher installed.
  - Necessary Python packages installed (e.g., pytest, selenium, requests). Check the test files for specific package requirements. You may need to install these using pip: `pip install pytest selenium requests` (example). The specific packages required will depend on the tests implemented in `test_one.py` and `test_two.py`.

 2.  **Installation/Cloning:**
  - Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/richard-pokee/crm-admin.git`
  - Navigate to the repository directory: `cd crm-admin`

 3.  **Configuration:**
  - Review the `test_one.py` and `test_two.py` files.
  - Configure the test scripts with the appropriate CRM system credentials (username, password, API keys, etc.) and environment settings (URL of the CRM system). These configurations are typically done within the test scripts themselves or through environment variables. *Important: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into the script. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.*

 4.  **Running the Tests:**
  - Use a test runner like `pytest` to execute the tests.  For example: `pytest test_one.py test_two.py`
  -  If you only want to run one test script: `pytest test_one.py`
  -  Refer to the `pytest` documentation for more options (e.g., running tests with specific markers, generating reports).

 5.  **Interpreting the Results:**
  - The test runner will output the results of each test case (pass/fail).
  - Analyze the results to identify any issues with the CRM system.
  - Investigate failed tests and update the test scripts or the CRM system as needed.
